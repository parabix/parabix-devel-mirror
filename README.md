### Documentation
For more information about Parabix, please check our [wiki](https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel/-/wikis/home) or reach out to us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/parabix-devel/community).

### Tools
Parabix includes a set of built-in [tools](https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel/-/tree/master/tools), such as [`icgrep`](README-icgrep.md), which is a very fast regular expression search program.

### Requirements

To build Parabix, you need a development environment that meets a few requirements.

-  Standard C++ development tools including git, C++, etc.
-  A modern C++ compiler supporting at least C++ 11.
-  The [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/download/) build system version 2.8 or better.
-  [`Boost`](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) libraries version `1.61` or better.
-  An [`LLVM`](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) system version `5` or better.

### Build

- Clone parabix-devel from the repository:
  `git clone https://cs-git-research.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/cameron/parabix-devel.git`
- Create a build subdirectory
  - `cd parabix-devel`
  - `mkdir build`
  - `cd build`
- Create the makefiles
  `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
  - _Note: if you have built/installed a custom LLVM version, you may need to override cmake's default search path._
`cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/libllvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
- `make`
- If you wish to run the test suite, while you are still in the build directory, run the following command:
`make check`

In the configuration above, all compiled tools will then be found on `/path/to/parabix-devel/build/bin`
