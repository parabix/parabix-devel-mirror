/*  To implement a callback, the following steps are required.
 
    1.  A suitable handle_signal method is required.   The default
        handle_signal method simply counts the number of signals
        received and the value of the last signal received.
        If different behaviour is needed, define a subclass of SignallingObject
        with a suitable overridden handle_signal method.
 
    2.  Pass the address of your callback object as an input scalar
        to the kernel.
 
    3.  Create a LLVM Call to the signal dispatcher.  Assume the address
        of the call back object is stored in "handler_address".  The
        following code is illustrative.
        Value * handler = b->getScalarField("handler_address");
        Function * const dispatcher = m->getFunction("signal_dispatcher");
        FunctionType * fTy = dispatcher->getFunctionType();
        b->CreateCall(fTy, dispatcher, {handler, theSignal});
 
    4.  Ensure that the address of the signal_dispatcher is available
        to the JIT engine (should be automatic with LoadDynamicLibraryPermanently).
